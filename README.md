# Weather Forecasting Tool ☁️🌦️

## Description
The Weather Forecasting Tool is a command-line application that provides the current weather forecast for a specified city. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. This tool demonstrates the usage of GitHub Copilot to facilitate API integration, data parsing, and error handling.

## Features ✨
- Accepts a city name as user input to retrieve the current weather forecast.
- Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the specified city.
- Parses the retrieved data to extract relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Displays the parsed data in a readable format to provide the current weather forecast to the user.
- Handles errors gracefully, including network errors, invalid city names, and API request failures.

## GitHub Copilot Hackathon 🚀
This project is developed as part of the GitHub Copilot Hackathon hosted by Microsoft Corporation. The hackathon aims to explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant developed by OpenAI. By participating in this hackathon, developers have the opportunity to showcase how Copilot can enhance the development process by generating code suggestions and assisting with various tasks.


## GitHub Copilot 🤖
This project showcases the usage of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant developed by OpenAI. Copilot assists developers by generating code suggestions and completing repetitive tasks. In this project, GitHub Copilot has been utilized in the following ways:

- API Usage: Copilot provides code snippets for interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API, including handling authentication, constructing HTTP requests, and handling API responses.
- Data Parsing: Copilot suggests code snippets for parsing the retrieved weather data, making it easier to extract the desired weather information from the API response.
- Error Handling: Copilot offers suggestions for handling various error scenarios, such as network errors, invalid input, or API request failures. It helps in generating code for gracefully handling errors and displaying appropriate error messages to the user.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x
- Requests library (install using `pip install requests`)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up at https://openweathermap.org/ to obtain an API key)

## Usage 🚀
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

## pip install requests
3. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website.
4. Replace the `API_KEY` variable in the code with your API key.
5. Run the application using the following command:

## python WeatherForecastingTool.py
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the desired city name and view the weather forecast.
